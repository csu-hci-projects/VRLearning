* In her article, "Can virtual reality revolutionize education?," author Emma Kennedy explores the emerging use of virtual reality in classrooms. Companies in the education-tech sector are springing up throughout the nation, providing over 6 million students the oppourtunity to experience VR-based lessons. Kennedy interviewed Guido Kovalskys, founder of education-tech company, Nearpod, for his explination on how VR learning can promote effective learning. He explains that kids are very engaged in VR lessons, and this technology can expose students to a multitude of learning topics at the flip of a switch. There is a "direct correlation between VR usage and increased engagement by students...added engagement boosts learning outcomes." However, VR should not be a replacement for other learning methods. Kennedy interviewed Professor Bailenson from Standford Univeristy, and he believes VR should be a supplement to learning, "It's about using VR to shake it up...stepping away from the mundane stuff and experiencing something."
