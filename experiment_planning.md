### Experiement Variables
**Independent:**
1. Lesson Medium - we will have a **VR** lesson and a **traditional 2D** application lesson

**Dependent:**
1. Information Retention - how well participants remember the presented infomrmation
<hr>

### Participants
* Participants will be divided into two groups (VR and 2D), because the presented information will be the same for both. Particpants will be drawn from members of the CS464 class.
<hr>

### Experiment Procedure
1. Participant will be given a lesson in either a VR or traditional 2D application environment
2. Following the lesson, participants will be quized on this information using a short (10 question) multiple choice quiz
3. Finally, participants will be survey on their experience with their respective lesson medium (rate their level of engagement, provide opinions on the viablity of their lesson medium, satisfaction with the experience).

### Data to Collect
1. Quiz scores
2. Participant survey results

* The data will be compared using a between group design (VR and 2D)
* We will use this data to determine which of the two digital mediums creates the most effective learning experience.
