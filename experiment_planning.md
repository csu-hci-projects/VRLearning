### Experiement Variables
**Independent:**
1. Lesson Medium - we will have a **VR** lesson and a **traditional 2D** application lesson

**Dependent:**
1. Information Retention - how well participants remember the presented infomrmation
<hr>

### Participants
* Participants will be divided between-subjects into two even-sized groups, because the presented information for both lectures will be the same. One of the groups will be presented a lecture using a 2D display, the other group will be presented the same lecture in a VR environment. Participants will be selected from non-computer science major CSU students, as the lecture serves as an introduction to basic computer science principles.

### Experiment Procedure
1. Participant will be given a brief introduction to the experiment; they will be told that they will receive a lecture, followed by a short quiz covering the information from the lecture.
1. Participant will be given a lesson in either a VR or traditional 2D application environment. The lesson will be an introduction into digital logic and boolean algebra.
2. Following the lesson, participants will be quized on the covered topics using a short (10 question) multiple choice quiz.
3. Finally, participants will be surveyed on their experience with their respective lesson medium (rate their level of engagement, provide opinions on the viablity of their lesson medium, satisfaction with the experience).

### Data to Collect
1. Quiz scores
2. Participant survey results

* A two-sample t-test will be used to compare the results of the two groups to find a possible statistical significance
* We will use this data to determine which of the two digital mediums creates the most effective learning experience.
