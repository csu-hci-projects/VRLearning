### Project Prototype Planning
---
We're planning to produce two digital learning experiences. One will be a traditional 2D digital lesson using a computer, the other will be a lesson using a VR headset. Both lessons will cover the same content, we will focus on teaching computer science principles which can be easily visualized or have an aspect of interaction to them, such as algorithms, data structures, or logic gates.

In each lesson, participants will be presented with information that they will need to remember to be able to answer questions on a quiz following the lesson. These results will help us to compare the two learning mediums, and to see if VR provides and benefit to information retention.

The traditional lesson will be a 2D application where users are presented with text and images explaining computer science principles. Participants may also interact with the application in ways such as acting out how algorithms perform or re-arranging logic gates.

The VR lesson will be much the same. We will use the same text and images across both presentations. Similarly, interactive elements of the lecture will also be present. We think that VR will have an advantage in this area, and will be able to create much more interaction with the content which may help participants remember the information better.

The traditional lesson will be done using a laptop/desktop computer using a mouse and keyboard.
The VR lesson will be done using an Oculus Rift VR headset/Controllers. We are also exploring how this could be implemented using Google Cardboard/Samsung Gear VR which would allow us to use smart phones to present the lesson in VR.
The VR lesson will be produced using Unity engine. The traditional 2D lesson will either be produced using Unity engine or using python
